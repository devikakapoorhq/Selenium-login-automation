# About Me
Hi! I'm applying for the QA Intern role at Intervue.

Through this project, I demonstrated:

✅ Real-world test automation using Selenium WebDriver

✅ Logical flow automation and error handling

✅ Debugging and scripting in Python

✅ Clean and reusable code practices

# The script is tested, runs successfully, and mirrors the flow from the assignment video with the login fail.

Feel free to connect if you’d like to discuss more as this position means alot to me and I am a fast learner who's dedicated to learning.
And this is what i want to demonstrate through my task, that I pick up stuff fast thus would be a good fit at Intervue.

Have a great day!
