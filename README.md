# About Me
Hi! I'm applying for the QA Intern role at Intervue.

Through this project, I demonstrated:

✅ Real-world test automation using Selenium WebDriver

✅ Logical flow automation and error handling

✅ Debugging and scripting in Python

✅ Clean and reusable code practices

The script is tested, runs successfully, and mirrors the flow from the assignment video.

Feel free to connect if you’d like to discuss, I am a fast learner who's dedicated to learning.
If I have made any errors or this simple web automation task is not upto the mark, I apologise and can assure, with more time and guidance I can give satisfactory results as I am committed to the job.
And this is what i want to demonstrate through my task, that I am fast learner and thus would be a good fit at Intervue.
